        "Ans> Broadcasting in NumPy allows us to perform arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes without reshaping them. It automatically adjusts the smaller array to match the larger array's shape by replicating its values along the necessary dimensions. This makes element-wise operations more efficient by reducing memory usage and eliminating the need for loops. In this article, we will see how broadcasting works."
